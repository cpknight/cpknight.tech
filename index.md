### Welcome to `cpknight.tech`:

I design and build low-cost autonomous sensor payload packages that attach to aerial drones, as well as their related accessories. This website provides documentation and other information relating to the devices that I design and build.

### Product Information:

- [**Digital Satellite Clock** (dSc)](digital-satellite-clock/)
- [**Personal Autonomous Reconnaissance Observer** (PARO)](personal-autonomous-reconnaissance-observer/)

### About Me:

I'm a sweet, doughnuty Cascadian who lives on the Rockies' Eastern steppe in Calgary, Alberta. For more information about my tech and process, please check out [GitHub](https://github.com/cpknight) or contact me via [Twitter/𝕏](https://x.com/cpknight) or [email](mailto:chris@cpknight.io).
